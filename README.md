# Error Handlers

In our solidity code, we have used three error handlers to show their demonstration

## Description

In this project we have declared three functions where we have showed the working of three error handlers- require, assert and revert where require takes one condition and a statement as a parameter whereas revert takes only one which is the statement to print and assert takes only parameter which is the condition .

## Executing Programs

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., errorhandling.sol). Copy and paste the  code present in the errorhandling.sol into the file:
